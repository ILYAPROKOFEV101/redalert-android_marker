<h1>Custom Map Markers</h1>

<p>Hello! I am Ilya Prokofiev, a developer from Russia with a strong desire to help everyone suffering from the consequences of war.</p>

<p>This project provides a small piece of code that simplifies rendering custom markers on a map. It allows you to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Render any markers in XML format based on Google Icons.</li>
    <li>Customize marker size and color to suit your needs.</li>
    <li>Enjoy faster rendering using efficient system methods with lightweight image caching.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Customizable Markers:</strong> Easily adjust the size and color of the markers.</li>
    <li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Markers are rendered quickly thanks to system-based drawing methods and caching.</li>
    <li><strong>Versatile Usage:</strong> Perfect for enhancing navigation with visually distinct markers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some examples of how the markers look:</p>

<div style="display: flex; overflow-x: auto; gap: 20px; padding: 10px 0;">
    <div style="flex: 0 0 auto;">
        <h3>Example 1</h3>
        <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb01e023-c8ab-4c80-914c-8b99a36d3a42" width="300" height="533" alt="Example 1">
    </div>
    <div style="flex: 0 0 auto;">
        <h3>Example 2</h3>
        <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1bd6485-c54c-4a8a-b7e5-fb3c943624f8" width="300" height="533" alt="Example 2">
    </div>
    <div style="flex: 0 0 auto;">
        <h3>Example 3</h3>
